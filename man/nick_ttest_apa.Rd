\title{APA-Style T-Test Reporting Function}
\usage{
nick_ttest_apa(
  data,
  group,
  variables,
  language = "en",
  output_file = "APA_Table.docx",
  export = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the dataset.}

\item{group}{A character string specifying the grouping variable. This variable must have exactly two levels.}

\item{variables}{A character vector specifying the names of numeric variables to test.}

\item{language}{A character string specifying the language for the output. Options are "en" (English, default) or "ger" (German).}

\item{output_file}{A character string specifying the file name for the exported Word document. Defaults to "APA_Table.docx".}

\item{export}{A logical value. If `TRUE`, the table and text reports are exported to a Word document. If `FALSE`, the table is displayed in the RStudio Viewer, and the text is printed to the console. Defaults to `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
A `flextable` object containing the formatted APA-style table. When `export = FALSE`, the table is shown in the Viewer, and text reports are printed to the console. When `export = TRUE`, both are saved to a Word document specified by `output_file`.
}
\description{
This function performs independent t-tests for each numeric variable in the dataset grouped by a categorical variable, producing descriptive statistics, inferential statistics (t-values, degrees of freedom, p-values), and effect sizes (Cohen's d) in APA style. The results are presented as a formatted table and APA-style text, with an option to export them to a Word document.
}
\details{
This function is designed for two-group comparisons using independent (Welch) t-tests. It dynamically generates APA-style reports in English or German based on the `language` parameter. The output can be tailored for console/Viewer display or exported to a Word document for use in reports and publications.

\examples{
# Example usage
library(dplyr)
data(mtcars)
mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am) # Convert grouping variable to a factor

# Generate APA-style table and text without exporting
nick_ttest_apa(mtcars, group = "am", variables = c("mpg", "hp"), language = "en", export = FALSE)

# Generate APA-style table and text and export to a Word file
nick_ttest_apa(mtcars, group = "am", variables = c("mpg", "hp"), language = "ger", output_file = "APA_Output.docx", export = TRUE)

}
